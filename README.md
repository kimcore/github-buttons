# [GitHub Style Button as a Service](https://github-buttons.vercel.app)

This is a service that generates dynamic <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> Style Button images that you can embed in your markdown files.
For each keystroke, headless chromium is used to render an HTML page and take a screenshot of the result which gets cached.
